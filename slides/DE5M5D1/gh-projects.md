## <mark>Learners will need to track their work</mark>

- Break big project into small tasks
- Track what's done vs what's left
- Update as you progress
- Use it for planning (what's next?)

### GitHub Projects
- Best for integration

### Markdown checklist
- Simplest

### Trello
- Most visual (but separate tool)
