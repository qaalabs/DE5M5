# Library Pipeline: Sample Data

## Sample Data

This folder contains sample data for the library pipeline project.

- GitHub Link: https://github.com/ingwanelabs/library-pipeline-template/tree/main/data


## Files

- `circulation_data.csv` - Book circulation transactions (5,000 rows)
- `events_data.json` - Library events data (nested JSON)
- `feedback.txt` - Unstructured member feedback
- `catalogue.xlsx` - Book catalogue with metadata

## Data Quality Issues

These files intentionally contain data quality issues:

- Duplicate records
- Missing values
- Inconsistent date formats
- Nested structures requiring flattening

**Your task is to build a pipeline that cleans and validates this data.**
